International Workshop on Working towards Ontology-based Standards for Robotics and Automation (WOSRA 2023) @ [ICRA 2023](https://www.icra2023.org/), London, United Kingdom






**WORKSHOP MOTIVATION**

Robotics is becoming a mainstream domain with a wide range of applications with a medium and long term impact on everyone's lives. Current systems rely more and more on robot–robot communication and robot–human interaction. In terms of communication, a vocabulary with clear and concise definitions is a sine qua non component to enable information exchange among any group of agents, which can be human or non-human actors. This need for a well-defined knowledge representation is becoming evident if one considers the growing complexity of behaviors that robots are expected to perform as well as the rise of multi-robot and human–robot collaboration. This workshop has the purpose to increase interest in standardization for the Robotics and Automation (R&A) domain, as well as the ethical challenges involved with the interaction with humans. 

The existence of a standard knowledge representation would:
define precisely concepts and relations in the robot’s knowledge representation that could include, but is not limited to, robot hardware and software, environment, cause and effects of performing actions, relationship among other robots and people;
ensure common understanding among members of the community;
facilitate efficient data integration and transfer of information among robotic systems.
