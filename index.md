International Workshop on Ontologies and Standards for Robotics and Automation (WOSRA 2025) @ [ICRA 2025](https://2025.ieee-icra.org/), **May 19th**, Atlanta, USA


**Location:** Georgia World Congress Center, Atlanta, USA



**SCOPE**

Robotics is becoming a mainstream domain with a wide range of applications with both medium and long term impact on everyone's lives. Current systems rely more and more on robot–robot communication and robot–human interaction. In terms of communication, a vocabulary with clear and concise definitions is a sine qua non component to enable information exchange among any group of agents, which can be human or non-human actors. This need for a well-defined knowledge representation is becoming evident if one considers the growing complexity of behaviors that robots are expected to perform as well as the rise of multi-robot and human–robot collaboration. This workshop aims to increase interest in ontology formalization and standardization for the Robotics and Automation (R&A) domain, as well as the ethical challenges involved with the interaction with humans. 

The standard knowledge representation will: precisely define concepts and relations in the robot’s knowledge representation that includes, but not limited to, robot hardware and software, environment, cause and effects of performing actions, relationship between other robots and people; ensure common understanding among members of the community; facilitate efficient data integration and transfer of information among robotic systems.




**IMPORTANT DATES**

- Submission deadline: **March 24** 
- Notification: **April 14**
- Camera ready: **April 28** (details on 'Accepted papers' page)
- Workshop: **May 19**


**CALL FOR PAPERS**

Participants are invited to submit extended abstract papers of 2+n pages (n pages for references), or short papers of 4+n pages (IEEE format) for poster presentation in person at ICRA in Atlanta. Contributions shall be submitted through the EasyChair conference system. Extended abstracts shall focus on insights on new or ongoing projects on ontologies. The goal is to foster engaging technical and scientific discussions among ontology users and cultivate new collaborations. Short papers shall discuss previous or on-going research, preliminary results, use cases. The aim is to disseminate to the community research works but also encourage fruitful discussions on open problems and novel ideas.

All papers will be peer-reviewed (single-blind) and published on our website with the permission of authors. Submissions shall focus on subjects including but not limited to the following topics:
